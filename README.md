# Simple Flutter App with Clean Architecture

Welcome to the Simple Flutter App with Clean Architecture! This project serves as a learning experience for implementing Clean Architecture principles in Flutter development.

## Overview

This Flutter app demonstrates the concept of Clean Architecture, a software design approach that emphasizes separation of concerns and maintainability by organizing code into distinct layers.

## Features

- **Clean Architecture Structure:** The app is organized into layers including presentation, domain, and data, facilitating separation of concerns and promoting code reusability.
- **Modular Design:** Each layer is modular and independent, allowing for easy modification, testing, and maintenance.
- **Dependency Inversion:** Dependencies are inverted to enable high-level modules (e.g., presentation layer) to depend on abstractions (e.g., domain layer) rather than concrete implementations.
- **Testability:** Clean Architecture promotes testability by isolating business logic from external dependencies, making it easier to write unit tests and ensure code quality.
# _Further Learning_
This project serves as a starting point for understanding Clean Architecture in Flutter development. Further exploration and experimentation with Clean Architecture concepts and best practices are encouraged to deepen your understanding and improve your skills.
